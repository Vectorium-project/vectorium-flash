We decided to not publish the Vectorium flash's source code. 


The main reasons are the follows:


- Make the blockchain as distributed as possible (minable blocks will be distributed in the most decentralized way possible, via secured solo pools);


- Greater security, in fact a 51% attacks is very hard to do, the blockchain is stable even with only a graphic card;


- Greater advantage for small miner compared to mining farms;


- The blockchain is private and belong to Vectorium company; Anyway the mining is free and anyone with a graphics card can participate in mining;


- When the hashrate will be high, for more blocks distribution the miners will be paused and in the meantime they'll able to undermine other coins.
